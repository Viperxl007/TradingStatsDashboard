| Complex data structure in Excel files | High | Medium | Implement robust validation and transformation logic |
| Performance issues with large datasets | High | Medium | Use virtualization and optimize rendering |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Test across major browsers and implement fallbacks |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Maintain clear requirements and prioritize features |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Impact if Delayed |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Excel file format | Need sample data to finalize import logic | High - Would delay data import implementation |
| Chakra UI | UI component library | Medium - Could use alternatives or basic styling |
| Recharts | Charting library | Medium - Could use alternatives or delay visualization features |

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. Users can import Excel files with trade data
2. The dashboard displays accurate summary metrics
3. Users can filter and analyze data by token
4. The system identifies and highlights trending tokens
