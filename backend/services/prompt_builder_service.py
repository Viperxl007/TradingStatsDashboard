QUALITY GATES (Most should pass for trade recommendation):
‚ñ° Trend clarity score ‚â• 7/10 
‚ñ° Support/Resistance quality ‚â• 6/10 
‚ñ° Risk/Reward ratio ‚â• 2:1 
‚ñ° Overall setup quality ‚â• 60% 
‚ñ° No conflict with macro trend (if macro confidence < 60%, require 70%+ setup quality)

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. SETUP QUALITY SCORING (MANDATORY):
Rate each factor 1-10:
- Trend Clarity: _/10
- Support/Resistance Quality: _/10
- Volume Confirmation: _/10
- Pattern Completion: _/10
- Risk/Reward Ratio: _/10
- Momentum Alignment: _/10
OVERALL QUALITY: _% (average √ó 10)

2. TRADE DECISION MATRIX:
- 80-100% Quality + Good Macro = HIGH CONFIDENCE TRADE (full size)
- 70-79% Quality + Good Macro = MODERATE TRADE (half size)
- 65-69% Quality + Bad Macro = LOW CONFIDENCE TRADE (quarter size)
- Below 65% Quality = NO TRADE (regardless of macro)

3. NO TRADE SCENARIOS (SELECTIVE POSITION):
You should recommend NO TRADE if MULTIPLE of these conditions exist:
- Choppy/unclear price action AND low quality score
- Risk/Reward below 1.5:1 AND poor trend clarity
- Quality score below 50% (not 60% - be less restrictive)
- Macro Trade Permission is NO_TRADE (hard rule)
- Multiple conflicting timeframe signals
- Very low volume AND poor liquidity

4. MANDATORY SKIP CONDITIONS (Any ONE of these = NO TRADE):
- Risk/Reward below 2:1
- Quality score below 65%
- Macro Trade Permission is NO_TRADE

IMPORTANT: "NO TRADE" should be used when setups are genuinely poor quality. Look for valid trading opportunities with reasonable quality scores (50%+). Professional traders are selective but still find 20-30% of setups tradeable.

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
Your response MUST include:

1. QUALITY ASSESSMENT SECTION:
"Quality Score: X%
- Trend Clarity: X/10
- Support/Resistance: X/10
- Volume: X/10
- Risk/Reward: X/10
Trade Decision: [HIGH_CONFIDENCE/MODERATE/NO_TRADE]"

2. If recommending a trade, include:
- Entry price with SPECIFIC trigger condition
- Stop loss with clear invalidation reasoning
- Target with realistic probability assessment
- Position size recommendation based on quality

3. If recommending NO TRADE, include:
- Specific reasons why setup doesn't qualify
- What would need to change for a valid setup
- Suggested monitoring levels

Remember: Professional traders are selective but still find 20-30% of setups tradeable. Quality over quantity ALWAYS wins.
Default to NO TRADE unless the setup is exceptional.

üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - EXISTING POSITION ASSESSMENT:
You MUST explicitly address this recent position in your analysis. Choose ONE of the following:

A) MAINTAIN EXISTING POSITION: If the previous recommendation is still valid, state:
   "EXISTING POSITION CONFIRMED: The previous {context['action']} recommendation at ${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')} remains valid. Current analysis supports maintaining this position."
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ENTRY STRATEGY STATUS: The previous recommendation was a "{context.get('entry_strategy', 'unknown')}" strategy with condition: "{context.get('entry_condition', 'No condition specified')}"
   
   üö® IMPORTANT: The timestamp ({context['hours_ago']:.1f}h ago) refers to when the ANALYSIS was made, NOT when any trade was executed.
   
   üîç ENTRY TRIGGER ANALYSIS: Based on candlestick data analysis:
   {"‚úÖ ENTRY TRIGGER HAS BEEN HIT - " + context.get('trigger_message', '') if context.get('trigger_hit') else "‚è≥ ENTRY TRIGGER NOT YET HIT - Still waiting for entry condition"}
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If maintaining, you MUST use the EXACT SAME entry price (${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')}) in your recommendations.
   DO NOT suggest a different entry price unless there's a fundamental change in market structure.

B) MODIFY EXISTING POSITION: If adjustments are needed, state:
   "POSITION MODIFICATION: The previous {context['action']} at ${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')} needs adjustment due to [specific reason]. New levels: [specify changes]"

C) CLOSE EXISTING POSITION: If the position should be closed, state:
   "POSITION CLOSURE: The previous {context['action']} at ${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')} should be closed due to [specific fundamental change]. Reason: [explain what changed]"

D) NEW POSITION (ONLY if fundamentally different): If recommending a completely new position, you MUST:
   1. First address the existing position status
   2. Explain what FUNDAMENTALLY changed to invalidate the previous analysis
   3. Justify why a new position is warranted instead of modifying the existing one

üîí CONSISTENCY RULE: Unless there's a clear fundamental change (major support/resistance break, trend reversal, etc.),
you should MAINTAIN the existing position with the SAME entry price. Minor price movements do NOT justify new entry levels.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ignore the existing position. You must explicitly reference it in your recommendations section.

üìä ACTIVE POSITION ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:
You MUST evaluate the existing position and provide explicit guidance:

2. ENTRY STRATEGY STATUS: The previous recommendation was a "{context.get('entry_strategy', 'unknown')}" strategy with condition: "{context.get('entry_condition', 'No condition specified')}"
   
   üö® IMPORTANT: The timestamp ({context['hours_ago']:.1f}h ago) refers to when the ANALYSIS was made, NOT when any trade was executed.
   
   üîç CRITICAL TEMPORAL ANALYSIS: You have the price when the analysis was made (${context.get('previous_analysis_price', 'N/A')}) vs current price (${context.get('current_price', 'N/A')}).
   
   You MUST determine and state:
   - Has this entry condition been triggered SINCE the previous analysis was made?
   - If PULLBACK strategy to ${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')}: Has price dropped to that level SINCE the analysis was made at ${context.get('previous_analysis_price', 'N/A')}?
   - If BREAKOUT strategy: Has the breakout occurred with volume SINCE the analysis was made?
   - Current position status: WAITING for entry condition OR entry condition has been TRIGGERED since analysis
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT assume the trade was executed just because an analysis was made. The analysis timestamp ‚â† trade execution.
   ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT assume entry condition was triggered just because price hit that level at some point - it must have happened AFTER the analysis.

3. CURRENT EVALUATION: Based on current chart conditions, should this position be:
   - MAINTAINED (if thesis still holds) - DEFAULT CHOICE unless fundamentally changed
   - MODIFIED (if levels need adjustment)
   - CLOSED (if thesis invalidated)
   - REPLACED (if fundamentally different opportunity exists)

4. EXPLICIT RECOMMENDATION: You must state one of:
   "MAINTAIN: Continue holding the {context['action']} position from ${context.get('entry_price', 'N/A')}"
   "MODIFY: Adjust the {context['action']} position levels to [new levels] due to [reason]"
   "CLOSE: Exit the {context['action']} position due to [specific change in thesis]"
   "REPLACE: Close existing position and enter new position due to [fundamental change]"

üîí BIAS TOWARD CONSISTENCY: Unless there's a clear fundamental change in market structure,
you should DEFAULT to MAINTAINING the existing position. Minor price fluctuations do NOT justify position changes.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not provide new recommendations without first addressing the existing position status.
If you choose MAINTAIN, use the EXACT SAME entry price in your recommendations.
