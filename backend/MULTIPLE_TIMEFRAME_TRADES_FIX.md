# Multiple Timeframe Trades Fix

## Problem Description

When multiple chart reads were performed for the same ticker on different timeframes (e.g., 15min, 1h, 4h), only the first trade recommendation would appear in the active trades tab. Subsequent chart reads for the same ticker would either update the existing trade or return the existing trade ID instead of creating separate trades for each timeframe.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `ActiveTradeService.create_trade_from_analysis()` method at lines 766-770. The existing trade check query did not filter by timeframe:

```sql
-- BEFORE (problematic)
SELECT id, status FROM active_trades
WHERE ticker = ? AND status IN ('waiting', 'active')
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

This meant that when creating a trade for a new timeframe, the system would find the existing trade from a different timeframe and either update it or skip creating a new one.

## Solution

### 1. Trade Creation Logic Fix

**File:** `backend/services/active_trade_service.py`

**Lines 766-770:** Updated the existing trade check to include timeframe filtering:

```sql
-- AFTER (fixed)
SELECT id, status FROM active_trades
WHERE ticker = ? AND timeframe = ? AND status IN ('waiting', 'active')
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

### 2. Trade Retrieval Logic Enhancement

**File:** `backend/services/active_trade_service.py`

**Lines 897-906:** Enhanced the `get_active_trade()` method to properly handle timeframe filtering:

```python
# BEFORE
query = '''
    SELECT * FROM active_trades
    WHERE ticker = ? AND status IN ('waiting', 'active')
'''
params = [ticker.upper()]

if timeframe:
    query += ' AND timeframe = ?'
    params.append(timeframe)

# AFTER
if timeframe:
    query = '''
        SELECT * FROM active_trades
        WHERE ticker = ? AND timeframe = ? AND status IN ('waiting', 'active')
    '''
    params = [ticker.upper(), timeframe]
else:
    # When no timeframe specified, get the most recent trade across all timeframes
    query = '''
        SELECT * FROM active_trades
        WHERE ticker = ? AND status IN ('waiting', 'active')
    '''
    params = [ticker.upper()]
```

## Impact

### âœ… What This Fix Enables

1. **Multiple Active Trades Per Ticker**: Now supports having separate active trades for the same ticker on different timeframes (15m, 1h, 4h, etc.)

2. **Proper Trade Isolation**: Each timeframe's trade recommendation is stored and managed independently

3. **Complete Active Trades Display**: The active trades tab will now show all trade recommendations for all timeframes of the same ticker

4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality for single-timeframe trades continues to work unchanged

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **Database Schema**: No changes required - the `active_trades` table already had a `timeframe` column
- **API Endpoints**: The `/active-trades/all` endpoint already queries all active trades correctly
- **Frontend**: The trade cards already display timeframe information, so they will automatically show the different timeframes

## Testing

### Automated Test

Created `backend/test_multiple_timeframe_trades.py` which:
- Creates 3 separate trades for the same ticker on different timeframes (15m, 1h, 4h)
- Verifies each trade is created with unique IDs and parameters
- Confirms all trades are retrievable independently
- Validates the database stores all trades correctly

**Test Results:** âœ… PASSED - All 3 trades created successfully and retrievable independently

### API Endpoint Test

Created `backend/test_api_endpoint.py` which:
- Tests the `/active-trades/all` endpoint
- Confirms multiple trades are returned correctly

**Test Results:** âœ… PASSED - API endpoint working correctly

## Usage Example

Now when you perform chart reads for the same ticker on different timeframes:

1. **15min chart read** â†’ Creates Trade ID 147 for BTCUSD (15m)
2. **1h chart read** â†’ Creates Trade ID 148 for BTCUSD (1h) 
3. **4h chart read** â†’ Creates Trade ID 149 for BTCUSD (4h)

All three trades will appear in the active trades tab with their respective timeframes clearly displayed.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/active_trade_service.py` - Core fix for timeframe filtering
2. `backend/test_multiple_timeframe_trades.py` - Comprehensive test suite (new)
3. `backend/test_api_endpoint.py` - API endpoint validation (new)
4. `backend/MULTIPLE_TIMEFRAME_TRADES_FIX.md` - This documentation (new)

## Deployment Notes

- **Zero Downtime**: This fix is backward compatible and requires no database migrations
- **Immediate Effect**: The fix takes effect immediately upon deployment
- **No Configuration Changes**: No environment variables or configuration files need to be updated
