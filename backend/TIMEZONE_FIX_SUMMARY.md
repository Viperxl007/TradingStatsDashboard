# Timezone Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The context service was reporting incorrect time differences (4.1 hours ago instead of 0.05 hours ago) due to timezone mismatch.

## 🔍 Root Cause
**UTC vs Local Time Mismatch**: The service was using `datetime.utcnow()` for comparisons but SQLite was storing timestamps in local time.

### Evidence:
- Analysis timestamp: `2025-06-25 23:35:35` (local time)
- Comparison time: `datetime.utcnow()` (UTC time)
- Time difference: 4 hours (timezone offset) + actual time difference

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect):
```python
# Line 49-50: Used UTC for cutoff calculation
cutoff_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=lookback_hours)

# Line 115: Used UTC for time difference calculation  
hours_ago = (datetime.utcnow() - analysis_time).total_seconds() / 3600
```

### After (Correct):
```python
# Line 49-50: Use local time for cutoff calculation
cutoff_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=lookback_hours)

# Line 116-117: Use local time for time difference calculation
current_time = datetime.now()
hours_ago = (current_time - analysis_time).total_seconds() / 3600
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Before Fix:
```
Hours ago: 4.15 ❌ (Incorrect - included timezone offset)
Context message: RECENT POSITION (4.1 hours ago) ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Hours ago: 0.05 ✅ (Correct - about 3 minutes ago)
Context message: RECENT POSITION (0.0 hours ago) ✅
Context urgency: recent ✅
```

## 🎯 Impact

Now the accountability layer correctly identifies:
- **Recent positions** (< 6 hours): Require explanation for contrary actions
- **Active positions** (6-24 hours): Require position assessment  
- **Reference positions** (> 24 hours): Historical reference only

## 🚀 Status
**✅ FIXED** - Timezone handling now accurate with proper local time comparisons.
