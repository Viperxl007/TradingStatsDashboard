# Context Retrieval Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The accountability layer was not retrieving historical context despite recent analyses existing in the database.

## 🔍 Root Cause
**Database Path Mismatch**: The `AnalysisContextService` was being initialized with the default database path, which was different from the path used by the existing `chart_context_manager`.

### Evidence:
- ✅ Database contained recent analyses (ID 90 from 4.1 hours ago)
- ✅ SQL queries worked correctly when tested directly
- ✅ AnalysisContextService worked when tested in isolation
- ❌ Integration in routes.py failed due to wrong database path

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Before (Broken):
```python
# routes.py line 1280
context_service = AnalysisContextService()  # Used default path
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# routes.py line 1281
context_service = AnalysisContextService(chart_context_manager.db_path)  # Use same DB path
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Results:
```
✅ Context found!
Hours ago: 4.15
Context urgency: recent
Context message: RECENT POSITION (4.1 hours ago)
Action: buy
Entry price: $37.5
Target price: $41.5
Stop loss: $36.0
Sentiment: bullish
Confidence: 0.95

Enhanced prompt: 1,520 characters
Contains 'RECENT POSITION': True
Contains 'contrary action': True
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

When analyzing HYPEUSD again, the system should:

1. **Detect Recent Position**: "RECENT POSITION (4.1 hours ago)"
2. **Show Context Warning**: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: If recommending contrary action, please explain what has fundamentally changed"
3. **Enhanced Prompt**: Include historical context and forward-looking validation
4. **Accountability**: Require explanation for any contrary recommendations

## 🚀 Status
**✅ FIXED** - Context retrieval now working correctly with proper database path integration.
