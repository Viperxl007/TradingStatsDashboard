# Socket Stability Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to improve socket stability in the Trading Stats Dashboard application, addressing the flaky communications between frontend and backend.

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing socket-related errors, specifically:

```
OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket
```

This error occurred in the Python threading module while trying to serve the Flask application, causing unstable communications between the frontend and backend.

## Root Cause

The issue was related to how the Flask development server handles sockets in debug mode, particularly in a threaded environment on Windows. When Flask is run in debug mode with the default reloader, it runs the application in a separate process, which can cause socket management issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Server Configuration

Modified the Flask server configuration in `run_direct.py` to use more stable socket handling:

```python
# Before
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)

# After
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True, use_reloader=False, threaded=True)
```

The key changes are:
- `use_reloader=False`: Disables the auto-reloader that can cause socket issues
- `threaded=True`: Explicitly enables threading mode for better request handling

### 2. Frontend API Call Improvements

Added retry logic to the frontend API calls in `src/services/optionsService.ts`:

- Implemented a `fetchWithRetry` function that automatically retries failed API calls
- Set a maximum of 3 retries with a 1-second delay between attempts
- Added specific handling for network errors and 5xx server errors
- Updated all API call functions to use the retry mechanism

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **More Stable Socket Handling**: Disabling the reloader prevents socket-related errors in the Flask server
2. **Improved Error Recovery**: The retry mechanism allows the frontend to recover from temporary network issues
3. **Better User Experience**: Users will experience fewer connection failures and more reliable data fetching

## Additional Recommendations

For further stability improvements:

1. **Production Server**: For production use, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of Flask's development server
2. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for database and external API connections
3. **Health Checks**: Add periodic health checks between frontend and backend
4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

## Monitoring

Monitor the application for any remaining socket issues. If problems persist, consider:

1. Increasing the retry count or delay in the frontend
2. Implementing a more robust error handling strategy
3. Using a more production-ready server setup
