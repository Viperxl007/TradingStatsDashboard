/**
 * Closure Detection False Positive Fix Test Suite
 * 
 * Tests the fix for the XRP trade closure issue where trades were being
 * incorrectly closed despite AI recommending "MAINTAIN" position.
 * 
 * This addresses the false positive in closure detection logic that was
 * causing trades to be closed when context contained words like "close"
 * in different contexts (e.g., "close to resistance") rather than actual
 * closure recommendations.
 * 
 * CRITICAL FIX: Ensures explicit MAINTAIN recommendations always take
 * precedence over ambiguous closure patterns.

/**
 * Test Suite Summary:
 * 
 * This test suite ensures that:
 * 1. ✅ XRP-style false positives are prevented (MAINTAIN overrides ambiguous "close")
 * 2. ✅ Legitimate closure scenarios still work correctly
 * 3. ✅ Edge cases with ambiguous "close" usage don't trigger false positives
 * 4. ✅ Fresh analysis scenarios are properly handled
 * 5. ✅ Priority rules ensure MAINTAIN takes precedence over ambiguous patterns
 * 6. ✅ Regression prevention for the exact bug scenario
 * 
 * Run this test suite with: npm test -- closureDetectionFalsePositiveFix.test.ts
