   - Links to active trading positions
   - Dependency analysis with chart analysis and trade tracker

2. **Trade Tracker Entries** (`trade_tracker`)
   - Manual trade records
   - Historical performance data
   - Cross-references with AI trades

3. **Chart Analysis** (`chart_analysis`)
   - Source data for AI trade generation

   - Critical for maintaining trade history

4. **Active Trades** (`active_trade`)
   - Live trading positions
   - Production-critical data requiring special handling
   - Enhanced protection mechanisms

## 🚀 Deletion Strategies

### 1. Cascade Delete
- **Use Case**: Clean removal of completed/closed items
- **Behavior**: Deletes item and all dependent data
- **Safety**: Automatic backup creation

### 2. Preserve Dependencies
- **Use Case**: Remove specific items while maintaining data integrity
- **Behavior**: Deletes item but preserves dependent data
- **Safety**: Orphaned reference detection and handling

### 3. Warn and Stop
- **Use Case**: Protection of critical/production data
- **Behavior**: Prevents deletion and shows detailed warnings
- **Safety**: No data modification, alternative suggestions provided

## 📊 Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- ✅ 15+ test scenarios covering all deletion types
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (< 100ms single item, < 2s bulk operations)
- ✅ Backup/rollback validation
- ✅ Error handling and edge case testing
- ✅ Cross-database dependency validation

### Browser Console Testing
```javascript
// Available testing commands:
await deletionTesting.runTests();           // Full test suite
await deletionTesting.testStrategies();     // Strategy validation
await deletionTesting.testBackupRollback(); // Backup/restore testing
await deletionTesting.testPerformance();    // Performance benchmarks
```

## 🔗 Integration Points
